## What is this thing called Git?

Git is a Version Control System.

So far, we've been working on small projects with small groups. If we make mistakes, it isn't too hard to backtrack. However, as we begin to work on larger projects with larger groups, revising and adding code can become a tricky endeavor. What if one team member accidentally overwrites important code written by another team member? What if two team members try to edit a section of code at the same time? Disaster could ensue!

Enter Version Control Systems. Version Control Systems allow us to:

* Keep a log of changes made to a project
* Revert the project back to a previous state if we mess something up

Git also provides us an easier workflow to develop as a team, such as the ability to separate our work from others using branches. A branch is like a private copy of the main project that can be changed without modifying the original. These branches, when complete, may be merged back into the main project, bringing with it the accumulation of all the little changes made on it.

## How Git Stores Things

Two important concepts:

1. Git stores data as a series of snapshots.

  * Every time you make a commit, or store your data, Git takes a snapshot of all the changes you've made and stores a reference to that snapshot. We can easily look through previous commits and see what changes were made in each one. This concept of a "stream of snapshots" is what makes Git different from most other Version Control Systems.

2. Git performs most operations locally.

Git is distributed but centralized. What does that mean?

While a "master copy" of each repository (aka project) often lives in a remote location such as Github, each project contributor also keeps a copy of the repo, along with its version history, locally. When we want to look through past changes or save new changes to the project, we look to our local repo - no need to fetch data from the server every time.

Only when we want to push our changes up to the remote "master copy" or grab other people's changes do we fetch from or push to Github.

## The Three States of Git

So, how do we actually take advantage of Git's version control system? First, lets learn about the three states of Git.

Files can live in three different states: modified, staged, and committed. A typical Git workflow goes like this:

1. You make changes in your working directory. Your files are now **modified**.
2. You decide which files you want to add to your next commit and add them to the staging area. Your files are now **staged**. Don't want a change to be committed? Simple - don't stage that file.
3. You commit all of the files in your staging area and create a snapshot which permanently lives in your local Git directory. Your files are now **committed**.

(Note: all of this happens locally. Pushing files to your remote repository is a separate business.)

Ok, so how do we actually stage and commit files? To be explained in the following readings!
