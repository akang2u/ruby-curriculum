# Array/Hash Defaults

## Arrays of Arrays

Here's a very common problem that everyone will run into. Let's say we
want to make an array of arrays:

```ruby
[4] pry(main)> arr_of_arrs = Array.new(3, [])
=> [[], [], []]
[5] pry(main)> arr_of_arrs[0] << "a"
=> ["a"]
[6] pry(main)> arr_of_arrs
=> [["a"], ["a"], ["a"]]
```

Wait, what happened? We added `"a"` to the first array, but all of
them were modified?

The reason is that only **two** arrays are created in the example: (1)
`arr_of_arrs`, (2) the single empty array passed into the `Array`
constructor (`[]`). `arr_of_arrs` stores three **references** to the
same empty array.

Thus, when you access the array at position `0` and mutate it, you're
mutating the same array referenced by position at one and two.

The way to solve this problem is like so:

```ruby
[7] pry(main)> arr_of_arrs = Array.new(3) { Array.new }
=> [[], [], []]
[8] pry(main)> arr_of_arrs[0] << "a"
=> ["a"]
[9] pry(main)> arr_of_arrs
=> [["a"], [], []]
```

Here, instead of passing a reference to a single empty array (which
would be stored at three locations), we've passed a block. The block
will be run to produce a value to store for each position in the
array. The block constructs a new array each time it is run.

I wrote `Array.new` in the block to make it clear that a new array is
constructed each time the block is executed, but you could
equivalently write `[]` in the block.

## Mutable vs Immutable

Okay, we've seen that arrays store references to objects. We've seen a
naive problem where we stored several references to the same
object. Since all references refer to the same underlying object, a
mutation through one reference (`arr_of_arrs[0] << "a"`) is also
visible through another reference (`arr_of_arrs[1] == ["a"]`).

You may have previously written code like this:

```ruby
arr2 = Array.new(3, 1)

arr2[0] += 1
arr2[0] == 2
arr2[1] == 1
arr2[2] == 1
```

Does this contradict what we've just discussed about references and
mutations? Why isn't the change visible at position `1`?

Let's unpack `arr2[0] += 1`. This is Ruby shorthand for:

    arr2[0] = arr2[0] + 1

Let's further break this into steps:

0. First, fetch the number at position 0 (which is `1`).
0. Next, add one to this number. **This creates a new number
   object**. The `+` operation **does not** mutate the original
   object.
0. Finally, assign a reference to the new object (`2`) to position `0`
   of `arr`.

The trick is that we **never mutate** any number. We produce a new one
and reset `arr2[0]` to refer to the new object. That's why none of the
other indices are affected.

The `Fixnum` and `Float` classes are called **immutable**. None of
their methods modify data inside the `Fixnum`/`Float`; they produce
new values instead. `nil` is another example.

## Hash default values

Providing a default value for a Hash has the same issues as with an
Array:

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> cats = Hash.new([])
=> {}
[2] pry(main)> cats["Devon"]
=> []
[3] pry(main)> cats
=> {}
```

Providing an argument to `Hash.new` merely changes what is returned
when we look up a key that isn't present in the hash. Note how this
doesn't assign a value to `"Devon"` through mere access of the key. To
do that, we can do something like:

```ruby
[4] pry(main)> cats["Devon"] += ["Earl"]
=> ["Earl"]
[5] pry(main)> cats
=> {"Devon"=>["Earl"]}
[6] pry(main)> cats["Devon"] += ["Breakfast"]
=> ["Earl", "Breakfast"]
[7] pry(main)> cats
=> {"Devon"=>["Earl", "Breakfast"]}
```

Better. `cats["Devon"] += ["Earl"]` means `cats["Devon"] =
cats["Devon"] + ["Earl"]`. This constructs a new array and stores it
for key `"Devon"`

But what about this?

```ruby
[7] pry(main)> cats = Hash.new([])
=> {}
[8] pry(main)> cats["John"] << "Kiki"
=> ["Kiki"]
[9] pry(main)> cats
=> {}
[10] pry(main)> cats["Raul"]
=> ["Kiki"]
```

Let's think through what's happening here. On line 8, we try to get a
value for `cats["John"]`. `"John"` is not a key in the hash, so the
default (an empty array) is returned. We then mutate the default value
by adding `"Kiki"` to it.

We never set a value for `"John"` though, so this is not stored in the
Hash (see the result of line 9).

Later, when we try to access some other non-present key (`"Raul"`),
the default value is returned again. But since we mutated the value by
shovelling `"Kiki"` in, this is no longer empty. This is bad, because
we never meant for `"Raul"` to own `"Kiki"`.

We can start to fix the problem as before:

```ruby
[11] pry(main)> cats2 = Hash.new() { [] }
=> {}
[12] pry(main)> cats2["Devon"] << "Breakfast"
=> ["Breakfast"]
[13] pry(main)> cats2["George"]
=> []
```

Hash will use the block to produce a new default value each
time. Modifying the value won't have an affect on looking up other
non-existent keys, since we create a new value each time, instead of
reusing a single default object.

But we have the other problem again: we're still not setting a value.

```ruby
[16] pry(main)> cats2
=> {}
```

Let's fix this:

```ruby
[17] pry(main)> cats3 = Hash.new { |h, k| h[k] = [] }
=> {}
[18] pry(main)> cats3["Devon"]
=> []
[19] pry(main)> cats3
=> {"Devon"=>[]}
[20] pry(main)> cats3["John"] << "Kiki"
=> ["Kiki"]
[21] pry(main)> cats3
=> {"Devon"=>[], "John"=>["Kiki"]}
```

Here we've modified the block to take two arguments: when Hash needs a
default value, it will pass itself (`h`) and the key (`k`). The block
will not only create an empty array, but also assign it to the hash.

You can see one somewhat funny side-effect when we look up `"Devon"`;
even when we just want to lookup a value, if it is not present we'll
incur the side-effect of mutating the hash (the key `"Devon"` got
added).
