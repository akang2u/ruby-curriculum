# Testing Small

Make a sample card to play around with.  Open up pry and make a new card (something like `card = Card.new`).
In your code, play around with how you assign variables.

For example:
```ruby

  def hide
    face_up = false
  end

```

Reload your code.  In pry, call `card.hide` and see what happens.  Does it change the way you expected?

```ruby
  def hide
    self.face_up = false
  end
```

Reload your code.  In pry, call `card.hide` and see what happens.  Does it change the way you expected?

```ruby
  def hide
    @face_up = false
  end
```

Reload your code.  In pry, call `card.hide` and see what happens.  Does it change the way you expected?

What's the difference between the different ways of writing the method?  You might have to google for the subtle differences.

The overall goal here is to **test your code out with simple examples**.

If you can test one card on its own, it's a lot easier than trying to test the card through other code.  In this case, you shouldn't test `card.hide` by calling a different method that calls `card.hide` inside.

For example, it would be hard to test `card.hide` by calling the method below.  There's too much stuff to wade through:

```ruby
  class Board
    #...

    def update_cards
      puts "updating the cards"
      self.repopulate
      # a bunch of other methods

      @cards.each do |card|
        @grid << card
        card.flip
        # a bunch of other methods

        card.hide #the actual line we want to test
      end
    end

  end

  board = Board.new
  board.update_cards
  board.render
```

There's way too much going on for your brain to easily tell when card.hide *actually* gets called.  And it's hard to tell if anything else is changing `face_up` on the card.  Instead, try to test one card on its own.

Benefits: You saved at least five minutes by testing small instead of hacking through a huge block of buggy code.  You have to test your code many times a day (almost every time you make a change).  Imagine that savings multiplied over and over.  You're saving *hours* of your day by testing small.
