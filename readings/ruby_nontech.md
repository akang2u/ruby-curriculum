# Ruby

Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto released the first version of the Ruby programming
language in 1995 in Japan. Ruby is dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, and
multi-paradigm. Let’s examine those terms.

### Dynamic

A dynamic programming language is one that can execute many common programming
behaviors at runtime (when the interpreter executes the program) that static
programming languages perform during compilation, when a program--the
compiler--translates high-level source code to a lower-level language (e.g.,
assembly language or machine code). Dynamic programming languages can compile
code at runtime and execute code during compile-time; the compilation and
runtime phases are muddled. Though this flexibility enables metaprogramming,
more abstraction, and less code, it comes at the expense of execution speed.

Ruby, like most dynamic programming languages, is also dynamically typed. In
dynamically typed languages, the language enforces type constraints at runtime;
whereas, in statically typed languages, the language enforces type constraints
at compile-time. The following method invocation in Ruby runs successfully at
runtime:

```ruby
def erroneous_addition(x)
  if x > 99999
    print "Luckily I'm a valid statement!"
  else
    print "The Ruby interpreter is about to be a complainy-pants!" + x
  end
end

erroneous_addition(Float::INFINITY)
```

Ruby doesn't check the validity of `erroneous_addition` until runtime. The
following invocation causes an error because the interpreter encounters the
erroneous branch of the conditional statement:

```ruby
erroneous_addition(1) # TypeError: no implicit conversion of Fixnum into String
```

Merely defining an equivalently erroneous method in a statically typed language
like Java will result in a compilation error, namely `incompatible types: String
cannot be converted to int`.

```java
class StaticallyTypedError {
  // Many statically typed programming languages require the programmer to specify variable types.
  // The first int refers to the type of the return value of the method.
  // The second refers to the type of the x parameter.
    public static int erroneousAddition(int x) {
      if (x > 99999)
       System.out.println("Luckily I'm a valid statement!");
      else
       System.out.println("Java is already angry!" + x);

      return "Java won't even let this method slide uninvoked!";
    }
};
```


### Reflective

Reflection is common among dynamic programming languages. Unlike mere type
introspection, which refers to the ability of a program to examine the type and
state of an object at runtime, reflection refers to ability of a program to
manipulate its own structure and behavior as data. In object-oriented reflective
languages like Ruby, reflection permits not only the examination of classes,
modules, and methods, but also instantiation and method invocation. Reflection
makes possible much of metaprogramming. Here's an example adapted from Wikipedia
of non-reflective and reflective call sequences in Ruby:

```ruby
# nonreflective
obj = Foo.new
obj.hello

# reflective
class_name = "Foo"
method_name = :hello

# The program can inspect and modify source code constructions such as classes
# and methods at runtime. It can even convert strings or symbols matching
# symbolic names of those constructions into references to them.
obj = Object.const_get(class_name).new
obj.send method_name

# The program can evaluate a string as if it were source code at runtime.
eval "Foo.new.hello"
```


### Object-Oriented

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that privileges objects
rather than actions and data rather than functions or logic. Adherents to OOP
conceive of a program as a society of objects that receive messages that they
then use to perform their own discrete operations. Objects typically contain
data in fields known as attributes and a set of associated methods that may
access and manipulate these attributes.

The most popular object-oriented languages, such as Java, Perl, Python, Ruby,
Objective-C, Smalltalk and Swift are class-based. Objects are instances of
classes, which usually determine type. Classes define the data format and
methods available to their instances or to themselves.

Classes often inherit from other classes in an "is-a-type-of" relationship. The
Dog class (the child class) might inherit from the Pet class (the parent class).
The child class inherits data definitions and methods from the parent class,
allowing for recycling. The child class may overwrite these definitions and
methods as well as add its own, thereby customizing and extending its parent.

Encapsulation is a principle of object-oriented design. It dictates that the
programmer:

  1. Place all code concerned with a particular set of data in one class.
  2. Hide methods and data essential only to a class's internal workings (this
technique is called information hiding). Conversely, the programmer should expose
via methods only what's necessary to a class's relationships with other classes,
thereby preventing external interference and misuse.

### Multi-Paradigm

Although Ruby is perhaps the object-oriented programming language par
excellence, it also supports procedural and functional programming.

Procedural programming privileges procedure invocations, i.e., method calls. In
procedural programming, the programmer specifies a series of procedures that
operate on data structures in systematic order. Object-oriented programming
joins data structures and methods into "objects" that operate on themselves.
Defining and invoking methods outside of a class in Ruby approximates procedural
programming because these methods are part of a single root object, limiting
object-oriented design.

Functional programming privileges pure functions, those whose return value is
only determined by the input, without side effects such as changes in state.
Adherents of functional programming conceive of computation as the evaluation of
mathematical functions. Via blocks, Ruby shares many features of functional
programming languages. Ruby features anonymous functions, lexical closures
(functions that capture variables in the context where they're defined), and
higher-order functions (functions that can accept functions as arguments and/or
return functions). As of Ruby 2.0, Ruby even supports lazy enumeration!


## Philosophy

In 2008, Matz declared that the primary purpose of Ruby is to "help every
programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be
happy." He elaborated:

> Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They
think, "By doing this, the machine will run fast. By doing this, the machine
will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something
something." They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on
humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application
of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves.

Ruby follows the Principle of Least Astonishment: it attempts to minimize
confusion for experienced users. Much of Ruby reads like English. It's designed
to be expressive, powerful, elegant, and flexible. There are myriad ways to do
almost anything in Ruby, a design decision inherited from Perl.


## Ruby vs. Python

Python is perhaps the most similar language to Ruby. Both are dynamic,
reflective, object-oriented, multi-paradigm scripting languages. They even use
similar syntax! Here are the primary linguistic differences:

  1. Python doesn't support blocks.
  2. Python has a richer set of data structures.
  3. Python is inflexible: there's one best way of doing things!
  4. Whitespace is syntactically significant in Python.
  5. Python is less object-oriented. It has primitive data types, which are more
fundamental than objects (not everything in Python is an object!), and many of
its object-oriented features were late additions.
  6. Ruby values elegance and "magic" over clarity. Here's how to determine the time one
 month from now in Ruby versus Python:

  ```ruby
  # RUBY
  require 'active_support/all'
  1.month.from_now
  ```

  ```python
  # PYTHON
  from datetime import datetime
  from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
  new_time = datetime.now() + relativedelta(months=1)
  ```

The most significant difference between Ruby and Python is their communities.
For better or worse, Ruby's popularity is tied to Rails. Hence Rails is the
testing ground for many innovations in web development. Airbnb, Apple, Github,
Groupon, Shopify, and Twitter all use Rails.

Python developers tend to be more conservative in general. Rubyists enjoy many
new linguistic features before Python developers catch on.

Because of the popularity of Rails, the fact that Python is older, and the
early porting of statistical libraries in R to Python, Python has a more
diverse community, including many more proponents in data science and academia.
Ruby has no equivalent to Python's SciPy, NumPy, Matplot lib, or NLTK (Natural
Language Toolkit) libraries.

## Vocabulary

#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is a process for writing software. Its basic steps are
as follows:

1. Add a test
2. Run all the tests and make sure the new test fails
3. Write code
4. Run all the tests and make sure the new test passes
5. Refactor the code.

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

BDD is an extension of TDD. It structures the testing process through the use
of user stories - a description of the user's use of the feature being
developed. The goal of the user story is to help focus the developer on what to
test and what not to test.

### Unit Test

Unit testing is a way of testing an application by breaking the application
down into its smallest constituent parts and testing each part in isolation. In
order to test parts of an application that rely on other code, unit tests
typically use mock objects to make sure that problems elsewhere in the code
won't cause the tests to mistakenly fail.

Unit testing is often automated at larger or more sophisticated companies.

### Integration Test

Integration testing is a form of testing in which units of code are combined
("integrated") and the results of their interactions are tested. This type of
testing is done after each of the individual units has been tested.

### Test Coverage

"Test coverage" refers to how much of a software program has been tested. This can refer to several things, including the percentage of functions that have been called by the test suite, or the percentage of statements in the code that have been executed by the test suite.
