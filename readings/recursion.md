# Recursion

## Recursive methods

A **recursive** method is one that calls itself. Each time the method
calls itself, it tries to solve a smaller **subproblem**. Think of
this as breaking a large problem into smaller problems. Each of these
may be divided again into still smaller subproblems.

The subproblems keep getting smaller and smaller, until they are small
enough to solve trivially and directly. These small subproblems are
called **base cases**. All recursive methods should eventually reach a
base case, lest they just loop forever.

The factorial operation is one example of a problem that can be solved
recursively. Recall that five factorial is:

    5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
    n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 1

We can also define factorial *recursively*:

    # this is math, not Ruby code.
    0! = 1
    n! = n * (n - 1)!

The first equation is the base case: `0!` is, trivially, `1`. For any
`n > 1`, we can use the second equation to break the problem into a
smaller one.

Let's implement this recursive definition:

```ruby
def factorial(n)
  if n == 0 # the base case
    1
  else # the recursive case
    n * factorial(n - 1)
  end
end
```

Let's walk through how this method is evaluated for `factorial(3)`

```ruby
factorial(3)
=> 3 * factorial(2)
=> 3 * 2 * factorial(1)
=> 3 * 2 * 1 * factorial(0)
=> 3 * 2 * 1 * 1
=> 6
```

## Mathematical induction

Recursion allows us to solve larger problems by breaking them up into similar,
smaller sub-problems that we can solve. Solving a problem using the solution(s)
to these smaller sub-problems uses an important concept called *mathematical
induction*, or simply *induction*.

Generally used in mathematical proofs, mathematical induction tells us that if
we can solve for a base case and we can solve for the general (or nth) case,
then we have solved for all the cases.

Here's an example:
I know that if I can count from `1` to `2`, by incrementing `1` by `1` (`1`
being the base case), I can count to `n+1` by (a) starting at `n` and (b) then
counting one more, `n+1`. Since I know how to count to `2` from `1` (just say
"one"; the base case), I know that I can count to `n` or any other number, no
matter how large.

The key to applying induction to solve problems is to (a)
identify how you can grow a smaller solution into a bigger solution,
and (b) identify base cases which will be the "foundation" of your
tower of recursion.

## Recursion vs iteration

Recursive methods can always be written *iteratively*: using loops
and no recursion. Let's try our hand at the factorial method:

```ruby
def factorial(n)
  result = 1
  (1..n).each do |i|
    result *= i
  end

  result
end
```

While any recursive method can always be written
iteratively, the iterative form can sometimes be
significantly more complicated. When choosing whether to solve a
problem recursively or iteratively, you should think about which
solution is more natural to your own mind.

## Recursion and Infinite Loops

Recursive calls must always make progress toward a base case. For
instance, this is no good:

```ruby
def fibonacci(n)
  case n
  when 1
    [1]
  when 2
    [1, 1]
  else
    # uh-oh. calls the same method!
    fibonacci(n)
  end
end
```

This recursion will never terminate for `n > 2`; it will just call
itself again and again. An infinite chain of recursive calls won't
just spin forever like a normal loop:

```ruby
[2] pry(main)> fibonacci(1)
=> [1]
[3] pry(main)> fibonacci(2)
=> [1, 1]
[4] pry(main)> fibonacci(3)
SystemStackError: stack level too deep
        from: /Users/ruggeri/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p194/gems/pry-0.9.10/lib/pry/pry_instance.rb:275
```

Each nested method call you make adds to the **stack** of open method
calls; each time a method ends, the stack size decreases by one. The
elements of the stack are called **stack frames**, and they contain
the local variables used by that method.

If you get caught in a recursive loop, the stack will grow infinitely
until the system runs out of memory. This is because our methods
depend on some method closing to close themselves (i.e., the base
case) in the Fibonacci example. Running out of memory like this is
called a **stack overflow**, and Ruby will tell you that the stack
level got too deep.

## Strategies for Programming Recursively

It helps to have a general strategy with which to tackle recursive
problems.

**Map out a recursive decomposition**: Think about how the problem
breaks down recursively. That is, how will you reduce the problem size
towards the base case.  It's sometimes helpful to even sketch it out.

**Identify the base case(s)**: The base case will be the case when the
stack stops growing - that is, when the chain of deferred operations
will begin to evaluate. What will your method return in the most
trivial of cases? Your recursive decomposition should always be moving
towards that trivial case.

**Think one level up from the base case**: What will happen when you
call your recursive method with a value that will require a single
recursive call - that is, with a value one away from the base
case. How will you have to manipulate that value in order to return
the right thing? Ensure your manipulation generalizes.

**Ensure that your return values from any case (base case or
otherwise) are always of the same type**. If you need an array as the
final return value then the intermediate return values must also be
arrays. Why? Because each of those intermediate values are returning
from the same method!

**Get a stack trace**. Ruby won't normally print a stack trace for stack
overflow errors, because this might print several thousand lines to the screen.
If you're having a hard time debugging a stack overflow, you can paste the
following code snippet at the top of your file. The snippet will intentionally
crash your program before the stack overflow occurs, allowing you to read the
stack trace.

```rb
MAX_STACK_SIZE = 200
tracer = proc do |event|
  if event == 'call' && caller_locations.length > MAX_STACK_SIZE
    fail "Probable Stack Overflow"
  end
end
set_trace_func(tracer)
```
