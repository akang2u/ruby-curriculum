# Aliases are your friend

## What's an alias?

An alias is a shell command that enables the replacement of a word with another
string. Aliases are not a git-specific tool, but git is a great use case. For
example, instead of

```bash
git commit -m 'add password length validation'
```

you can type

```bash
gcm 'add password length validation'
```

If you're doing git right, you're making a lot of commits, so even a small
optimization like this quickly becomes worthwhile. Aliasing your most commonly
used git commands can make the difference between you lazily neglecting to make
commits vs. committing frequently.

## Creating an alias

To create a persistent alias, you add a line to your shell's
configuration file. The specific name of this file can vary between
systems. On my Mac, `~/.bash_profile` does the job; on other systems,
you might want `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`. Open your config file (ex.
`atom ~/.bash_profile`) and add your desired alias on a new line at the
end of file, formatted like so:

```bash
alias gcm='git commit -m'
```

Save the config file and **open a new terminal tab**. You can now use your
alias.

## Adding aliases

Whenever I find myself typing a command repeatedly, I create an alias
for it. Here's (more or less) what [my ~./bash_profile][bash-profile]
looks like. I have aliases for git commands, filesystem navigation, and
Rails-related commands. (Don't worry if you don't understand what all of
the commands do.) I don't recommend copying this file directly, though.
It's better to build up your own personal set of aliases based on which
commands you use frequently and which abbreviations make sense to you.

I add shell aliases frequently enough that, somewhat recursively, I added an
alias to open my shell configuration file, so that I can easily add a new alias:
`alias bp='atom ~/.bash_profile'`.
