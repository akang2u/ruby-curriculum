# Git summary

### `git init`
* When you first begin your project, use `git init` to setup a git
  repository. You should do this before you write any code.
### `git status`

* Use this to see what modified files have not been staged, what
  files are untracked.

```bash
~/aa/ruby-curriculum$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#       modified:   README.md
#       modified:   git.md
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#       git-summary.md
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

### `git add`

* Use this to add files to staging. When you `git add` a file, the
  next time you commit, this version will be saved in the repo.
* NOTE: `git add` only adds the changes you have made thus far. This means that is you add a file's changes to staging, make more changes to it, then commit without re-`git add`ing it, those recent changes will not be committed.

```bash
~/aa/ruby-curriculum$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#       modified:   README.md
#       modified:   git.md
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#       git-summary.md
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~/aa/ruby-curriculum$ git add git.md
~/aa/ruby-curriculum$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#
#       modified:   git.md
#
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#       modified:   README.md
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#       git-summary.md
```

### `git commit`

This will save the work currently staged (from `git add`) into the
history by creating a new *commit*. A commit is a checkpoint that you
can return to later if your code gets screwed up.

**Commit frequently**. As you add small bits of functionality, write
fine-grained commits. Do not wait until you've written half your
program to commit.

Every time you are about to make a major change to your program, you
may want to commit what you have. That way, if you screw up, you can
undo easily.

You will be hard-pressed to over-commit when starting out. You
probably want to commit at least once every 5min. You may commit more
often if you add quick-to-write features.

* `git reset`

If you add something you don't want to add, and would like to unstage
all staged changes (so that the staged files return to "Changes not
staged for commit"), use `git reset`.

## Later

* `git clone`
* `git fetch`
