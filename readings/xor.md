# XOR (Exclusive OR)

## Definition

Like AND and OR, XOR (short for 'exclusive OR') is a [logical operator][log-op].

+ AND means 'Both A and B'.
+ OR means 'Either A or B or both'.
+ XOR means 'Either A or B, but not both'.

The 'but not both' clause is what differentiates XOR from OR. In ruby, XOR is written as `^`.

Let's look at a few examples of using XOR:
```rb
true ^ false # true
false ^ true # true

false ^ false # false
true ^ true # false

# Compare the last example against using OR
true || true # true
```

## Bit-wise XOR with numbers

When you XOR two numbers, Ruby converts them to binary and evaluates each their
corresponding digits (i.e. bits) using XOR where `1` is `true` and `0` is
`false`. Ruby then converts the binary result back into an integer.

For example,

```ruby
a = 2
b = 6
c = a ^ b # 4
```

Let's examine what ruby is doing under-the-hood.

```rb
# Converts the operators to binary
a.to_s(2) # "10"
b.to_s(2) # "110"

# Bit-wise operation
# a = 010
# b = 110
# xor ---
# c = 100

# Converts the result back to an integer
"100".to_i(2) # 4

# Thus,
c == 4 # true
```

In Ruby, `Integer#to_s(2)` converts a number to binary and `String#to_i(2)` converts a binary string to a number!

## Using XOR to hash

Recall the properties of a hashing function:  
+ **Determinism**: Its output is directly determined by the input data.
+ **Comprehensiveness**: It uses all the input data.
+ **Uniformity**: Its possible return values are evenly distributed.
+ **Continuity**: It does not return similar values for similar inputs.

Bit-wise XOR is often used in hashing functions because it promotes high
determinism, comprehensiveness, and uniformity. It also has high continuity,
which may need to be offset with other methods where a hashing function needs to
have a more unpredictable 'spread' of hashed values.

What separates XOR from other bit-wise operators is uniformity - Only XOR returns
`1` and `0` in equal probability, given any two inputs (see truth table below). This allows it to
produce more uniformly distributed values, distinguishing it as a desirable
hashing method.

## Truth Table for Bitwise Operations

| a | b | AND | OR | XOR |
|:-:|:-:|:---:|:--:|:---:|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |  0 |  0  |
| 1 | 0 |  0  |  1 |  1  |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |  1 |  1  |
| 1 | 1 |  1  |  1 |  0  |
