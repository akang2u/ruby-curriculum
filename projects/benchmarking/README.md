# Benchmarking

Ruby includes a Benchmark module in the standard library to test the execution time of code. This can be very useful if you need to approximate the real-world performance of different algorithms to determine which one is best for your particular application.

Go back through the days solutions and use `Benchmark` to verify the **Big-O** performance of your various solutions. You can find the docs [here][benchmark-docs], and there's an example of how to use it in the [sorting complexity demo][sorting-demo] from the readings.
