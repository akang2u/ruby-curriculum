# Ghost

Today we'll be writing a Ruby implementation of everyone's (or maybe
just my) favorite road-trip word game, [Ghost][ghost-wiki].

## Learning Goals

* Understand how different classes interact
* Be able to write classes in different files and use `require_relative` to
connect them
* Know how to test methods in pry
* Know how to read lines from a text file
* Understand how `__FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME` works

## Phase 1: Playing a Single Round

Let's start by writing the logic to play a single round of Ghost (that
is, playing until one player spells a word). Write your game for two
players only, and don't worry about keeping track of wins/losses (we can
get to this later). The basic logic will look something like this:

- Instantiate a new Game object, passing in both of the Players.
  - The Game maintains a `fragment` instance variable, which represents
    the word as it has been built up by the players.
  - The Players take turns adding a letter to the `fragment`. The Game
    should ensure that a play is valid before actually changing the
    `fragment`.
  - The Game checks the `fragment` against a `dictionary`; if the
    `fragment` is a word contained in the `dictionary`, then the
    previous player loses.

### Game

#### `#initialize`

Assign instance variables for the `players`, `fragment`, and
`dictionary`. Since we'll be checking the `fragment` for inclusion in
the `dictionary`, we'll want to use a data structure with fast lookup: a
Hash or Set would be ideal. You can use [this file][ghost-dictionary] to
populate your dictionary; it contains only words three letters or longer
(otherwise we wouldn't have a very interesting game).

#### `#play_round`

The core game logic lives here. I wrote a number of helper methods to
keep things clean:

- `#current_player`
- `#previous_player`
- `#next_player!`: switches the values of `current_player` and
  `previous_player`
- `#take_turn(player)`: gets a string from the player until a valid play
  is made; then updates the fragment and checks against the dictionary.
  You may also want to alert the player if they attempt to make an
  invalid move (or, if you're feeling mean, you might cause them to lose
  outright).
- `#valid_play?(string)`: Checks that `string` is a letter of the
  alphabet and that there are words we can spell after adding it to the
  `fragment`

### Player

I wrote `initialize`, `guess`, and `alert_invalid_guess` methods. You'll
probably want each `Player` to have a `name`, as well.

## Phase 2: Playing a Full Game

Now that we have the logic to play a single round of Ghost, we'll have
to add another layer.

#### `Game#losses` and `Game#record`

In a game of Ghost, a player "earns" a letter each time they lose a
round. Thus,
if Eric beats Ryan 3 times and loses once, then Eric has a "G" and Ryan
  has a "GHO". If a player spells the word "GHOST", they are eliminated
  from play (and in the case of two players, the other player wins).

I added a `losses` hash to my Game class. The keys to the hash are
`Player`s, and the values are the number of games that player has lost.
Update this at the end of `#play_round`. For flavor, I also wrote a
helper method, `#record(player)`, that translates a player's losses into
a substring of "GHOST".

#### `Game#run`

This method should call `#play_round` until one of the players reaches 5
losses ("GHOST"). I wrote a helper method, `#display_standings`, to show
the scoreboard at the beginning of each round. Remember to reset the
fragment at the beginning of each round, as well!

## Phase 3: Multiplayer!

Refactor your game to work with more than just two players. Instead of
ending the game when one of the players reaches five losses, simply
exclude that player from further rounds. End the game when only one
player is left standing. **Hint**: You won't be able to use an instance
variable for each player anymore. What data structure might we use as an
alternative?

## Phase Bonus

- Write an `AiPlayer` class for your Ghost game. You'll need to figure
  out the logic for picking a winning letter on each turn. In order to
  do this, your `AiPlayer` will need to know both the current fragment
  and the number of other players (`n`).
    - If adding a letter to the fragment would spell a word, then the
      letter is a losing move.
    - If adding a letter to the fragment would leave only words with `n`
      or fewer additional letters as possibilities, then the letter is a
      winning move.
    - Your AI should take any available winning move; if none is
      available, randomly select a losing move.
      - See if you can improve your AI by computing the entire tree of
        possible moves from the current position. Choose the move that
        leaves the fewest losers and the most winners in the tree.
