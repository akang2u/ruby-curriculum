# Git Workflow Homework

This homework will apply the tools you learned in the [git workflow reading][git-workflow].

[git-workflow]: ../readings/git-workflow.md

## My first git

### Getting git installed

Test if you've installed git by running `which git`.  If you've installed git,
something like `/usr/local/bin/git` will print out.  If nothing prints out, you
probably haven't installed git.

If you haven't installed git, install it [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

### Set Your Identity

GitHub uses the email you set in your Git configuration to associate commits to
your GitHub account. (This is how you get green squares!)

Test if you have your email set by running `git config --global user.email` in
your terminal. If it's blank, type `git config --global user.email
"example@email.com"` to set it. You will only ever need to run this once. Git
will always use this information for anything you do on your computer.

To set your email for a single repository, simply leave off the `--global` flag.
Run `git config user.email "example@email.com"` inside your repository. Check
that this was set up correctly by typing `git config user.email`. Also check
that the global user was not changed by typing `git config --global user.email`.

### Initialize git

Make a new folder on your computer.  `cd` into it and save a sample file (you
can put whatever you want in the file).

Run `git status` in terminal.  You should get an error.  Read the error and see
if it makes sense.

Now initialize git with `git init`.  Run `git status` again and compare.

### Adding a single file to git

Save a new sample file (don't add it yet).  Run `git status` and compare. Play
around with saving and adding new sample files to get a feel for it.

Git add the sample file you just made.  Run `git status` again.  What changed?

### Adding multiple files to git

Create three new files (don't add them individually), then run `git add -A`. Run
`git status` and compare.

**NB** - NYC folk - we blocked `git add -A` on our office computers. We will
explain why in lecture.

### Resetting a file

Run `git reset #{one_of_your_files.rb}`.  Run `git status` and compare.

Once you have a sense of what it means to be "staged" and "unstaged", commit
your change.

Run `git status` again (surprise!).  What changed?

Run `git log` and notice what shows up.

Run `git log -p` and notice what shows up.

Delete one of the sample files you made.

Run `git status`.  Run `git status` whenever you want feedback on what you did.

### Resetting git

Create two new files.  Run `git status`.

Run the following sequence of commands: `ls`, `git reset --hard`, `ls`, `git
status`.  What did `reset --hard` do?  It's dangerous, so use it sparingly.
Play with `reset --hard` a couple more times, try to figure out what it does.

Make a new file, add it, and commit.  Run `git log` to see both your commits.

## Branching out

Make and check out a new branch called `magic` by typing `git checkout -b
magic`.  Run `git branch` and see what shows up.  How can you tell which branch
you're on?

Make a new file called `rabbit.txt`.  Add and commit it.  Check out your master
branch again with `git checkout master`.  Run `git branch`, then `ls`.  Where
did the rabbit go?

Checkout your `magic` branch again and run `ls`.  It's like pulling a rabbit out
of a...never mind.  Play around with checking out some new branches.  Make a
branch off of magic, as well as a new branch off of master.  See how each branch
is independent?

Now checkout `master` and run `git merge magic` (you might have to run `:q` then
hit enter if a message pops up).  Now run `ls`.  Your rabbit should appear.


## Pushing to GitHub

Make a new repo on [github](https://github.com/new).  Follow the instructions
provided by github and push your code up.  You should be able to go to
`https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject` and see your files there.

## Do it visually

Draw out on paper how you would represent unstaged, staged, and committed
changes.  Use boxes, circles, and arrows to represent what's going on.  It's OK
if you don't have a perfect mental model.

## Bonus

`cd` into the `.git` folder and poke around.  Does anything look familiar?

## Learn More

If you'd like to learn more about using Git, check out the
[Git tutorial on Code Academy][code-academy-git]. In addition to reviewing
how to set up git, track files, and use branches, it also has useful material
on utilizing Git to collaborate with team members on the same code base.
