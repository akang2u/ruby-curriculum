# DIY ADTs

After you finish the exercises, or if you get stuck on one of the problems, you can view the solutions [here][adt-solutions].

## Exercise 1 - Stack

Let's write a `Stack` class.  To do this, use the following framework:

```ruby
  class Stack
    def initialize
      # create ivar to store stack here!
    end

    def add(el)
      # adds an element to the stack
    end

    def remove
      # removes one element from the stack
    end

    def show
      # return a copy of the stack
    end
  end
```

To test that your code works, create a new instance of the Stack class, and play around with adding and removing elements.  Remember, a stack follows the principle of LIFO!


## Exercise 2 - Queue

Now let's write a `Queue` class.  We will need the following instance methods: `enqueue(el)`, `dequeue`, and `show`.  

Test your code to ensure it follows the principle of FIFO.


## Exercise 3 - Map

As you saw in the videos for tonight, a map can be implemented using a 2D array.  Let's write a Map class (following a similar pattern to Stack and Queue) that implements a map using only arrays.  

Remember, a map stores information in key-value pairs, where the keys are always unique.  When implemented with arrays, a map might look something like this: `my_map = [[k1, v1], [k2, v2], [k3, v2], ...]`.  

Our Map class should have the following instance methods: `assign(key, value)`, `lookup(key)`, `remove(key)`, `show`.  Note that the `assign` method can be used to either create a new key-value pair or update the value for a pre-existing key.  It's up to you to check whether a key currently exists!

As always, test your code thoroughly to make sure all properties of maps are enforced.
